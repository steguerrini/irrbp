Welcome to IrrBP SDK.
IrrBP is an Irrlicht - Bullet wrapper to simply use the bullet' physics with irrlicht graphics.

> The wrapper is compiled against Irrlicht > 1.7.1 (also trunk versions) and Bullet 2.76. I'm not sure about backward compatibility
> The whole library is compiled under VS 2005.
> You can see the changelog in the "changes.txt" file
